# Eat-The-Burgers App

#### Burger App using Node, Express, Handlebars and our own ORM (Object-relational mapping). It uses the Modelâ€“View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app and Handlebars for generating the HTML.

## How the app functions:
  App Uses some CRUD functionality to `CREATE`, `READ`, and `UPDATE` From a created ORM. 

    1. READ function reads all the burgers from MySQL database and displays them with Handlebars.
    2.UPDATE function takes the Burger and Devours it which will hit a Express route `burgers/update` that changes the burger to devoured and re-routes the index page to show the updated list.
    3. CREATE function creates a new burger from the create form. After clicking the "create" button, the Express route `/burgers/create` is hit and the newly created burger is inserted into the MySQL database and displyed with Handlebars.
